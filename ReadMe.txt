# Guess the Number Game

This is an interactive number-guessing game where the player chooses how many digits (between 1 and 20) the target number will have. The game provides feedback after each guess, with color-coded boxes indicating whether the guessed digit is higher, lower, or correct. The goal is to guess all the digits in the least number of rounds.
